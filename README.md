Spotify Dataset EDA
Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Spotify dataset to uncover insights about song popularity, danceability, energy, tempo, loudness, and more. Using Python, pandas, and visualization libraries, this analysis highlights trends in music data that can inform recommendations and music analytics.

Dataset

The dataset contains information about Spotify tracks including:

popularity – Track popularity score

duration_ms – Track length in milliseconds

danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo

genre or artist information (if available)

Objectives

Identify key patterns and trends in music data

Examine relationships between numerical features and song popularity

Detect outliers and distribution patterns

Provide visual insights using histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and correlation heatmaps

Key Steps

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values and duplicates

Convert data types where necessary

Univariate Analysis

Histograms and boxplots for numerical features

Bivariate Analysis

Correlation heatmaps

Scatterplots and comparisons between features like popularity and danceability

Insights

Identify the most influential features affecting song popularity

Highlight trends for different genres or artists (if applicable)

Libraries Used

pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – Visualization



Key Insights

Popularity is often influenced by energy, danceability, and loudness

Outliers exist in duration and loudness, reflecting unusual tracks

Certain genres or artists may consistently show higher popularity

Conclusion

This EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of Spotify track features, helping data scientists, music analysts, or enthusiasts make data-driven decisions for recommendations, playlist creation, and music analytics.
